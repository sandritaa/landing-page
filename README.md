## Introduction

To kick-off project # 2, Udacity has provided some static starter HTML and CSS styling code. We will work between the three files, make some modifications and pull the necessary information to create an interactive Landing Page using JavaScript. 

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom or check-out the instructions link in this README.MS doc.
